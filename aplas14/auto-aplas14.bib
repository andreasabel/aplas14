		  datatype constructors, generalizing the notion of recursive
		  datatypes in functional programming languages such as ML
		  and Haskell. We address both theoretical and practical
		  issues resulted from this generalization. On one hand, we
		  design a type system to formalize the notion of g.r.
		  datatype constructors and then prove the soundness of the
		  type system. On the other hand, we present some significant
		  applications (e.g., implementing objects, implementing
		  staged computation, etc.) of g.r. datatype constructors,
		  arguing that g.r. datatype constructors can have
		  far-reaching consequences in programming. The main
		  contribution of the paper lies in the recognition and then
		  the formalization of a programming notion that is of both
		  theoretical interest and practical use. }}

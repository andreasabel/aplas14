We consider a simplified version of Nakano's guarded fixed-point types
in a representation by infinite type expressions, defined coinductively.
Small-step reduction is parametrized by a natural number ``depth'' that
expresses under how many guards we may step during evaluation.  We
prove that reduction is strongly normalizing for any depth.  The proof
involves a typed inductive notion of strong normalization and a Kripke
model of types in two dimensions: depth and typing context.
Our results have been formalized in Agda and serve as a case study of
reasoning about a language with coinductive type expressions.

\label{sec:intro}

In untyped lambda calculus, fixed-point combinators can be defined
using self-app\-li\-ca\-tion.  Such combinators can be assigned recursive
types, albeit only negative ones.  Since such types introduce logical
inconsistency, they are problematic, especially in Martin-L\"of
Type Theory and other systems based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism.
\citet{nakano:lics00} introduced \emph{a modality for recursion} that
allows a stratification of negative recursive types to recover
consistency.  In essence, each negative recursive occurrence needs to
be \emph{guarded} by the modality; this coined the term \emph{guarded
  recursive types} \citep{birkedalMogelberg:lics13}.\footnote{Not to
  be confused with \emph{Guarded Recursive Datatype Constructors}
  \citep{xiChenChen:popl03}.} 
Nakano's modality has found applications in functional reactive
programming \citep{krishnaswamiBenton:lics11} where it is referred to
as \emph{later} modality.

Due to space constraints, we can only give a sketch of the
formalization; the full Agda proofs are available online
\citep{abelVezzosi:guardedNormalization}.

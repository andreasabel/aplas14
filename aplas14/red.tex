\section{Reduction}
\label{sec:red}

In this section, we describe the implementation of parametrized
reduction $\red_n$ in Agda.  As a prerequisite, we need to define
substitution, which in turn depends on renaming
\citep{bentonHurKennedyMcBride:jar12}.

A \emph{renaming} from context $\Gam$ to context $\Del$, written $\Del
\aleq \Gam$, is a mapping from variables of $\Gam$ to those of $\Del$
of the same type $\va$.
The function $\arename$ lifts such a mapping to terms.

\input{Rename}

% We also give
% an inductive relational specification $\IndRen$ of $\arename$, which
% will be useful to show that strong normalization (sn) is closed under
% renaming and even the undoing of renaming (if a renamed term is sn, so
% is the original term).
%
% \input{IndRen}
%
Building on renaming, we define well-typed parallel substitution.
From this, we get the special case of substituting de~Bruijn index 0.

\input{Subst0}

Reduction $t \red_n t'$ is formalized as the inductive family $\vt \nred n
\vtprime$ with four constructors \AgdaInductiveConstructor{β...}
representing the contraction rules and one congruence rule $\tcong$ to
reduce in subterms.

\input{NReduction}

The congruence rule makes use of shallow one hole contexts $\vC$, which
are given by the following grammar
\[
  \vC ::= \lambda x \_  \mid \_\,u \mid t\,\_
  \mid (t,\_) \mid (\_,u) \mid \fst\_ \mid \snd\_
  \mid \tnext\,\_ \mid \_∗u \mid t∗\_
.\]
$\tcong$ says that we can reduce a term, suggestively
called $\vCt$, to a term $\vCtprime$, if (1) $\vCt$ decomposes into
$\vC[\vt]$, a context $\vC$ filled by $\vt$, and (2) $\vCtprime$ into
$\vC[\vtprime]$, and (3) $\vt$ reduces to $\vtprime$.  As witnessed by
relation $\NbetaHole {Ct} C t$, context
$\vC : \NbetaCxt\;\Gam\;\Del\;\va\;\vb\;\vn\;\vnprime$ produces a term
$\vCt : \Tm\;\Gam\;\vb$ of depth $\vnprime$ if filled with a term $\vt
: \Tm\;\Del\;\va$ of depth $\vn$.  The depth is unchanged except for
the case $\anext$, which increases the depth by 1.
Thus,  $\vt \nred n \vtprime$ can contract every subterm that is under
at most $\vn$ many $\anext$s.

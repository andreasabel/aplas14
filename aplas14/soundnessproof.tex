\section{Soundness}
\label{sec:soundess}

A well-established technique 
\citep{tait:functionalsFiniteTypeI} to prove strong normalization is to model
each type $\va$ as a set $\A = \den{\va}$ of sn terms.  Each so-called
semantic type $\A$
should contain the variables in order to interpret open terms by
themselves (using the identity valuation).
To establish the conditions of semantic types compositionally, 
the set $\A$ needs to be \emph{saturated},
\ie, contain $\SNe$ (rather than just the variables) and be closed
under strong head expansion (to entertain introductions).
